A maioria dos laboratórios que fazem exames genéticos, disponibilizam os dados brutos do DNA analisado para download (aproximadamente 650.000 linhas).
Com tais dados em mãos, temos acesso ao SNP, sigla em inglês para Polimorfismo de Nucleotídeo Único, que é uma variação do DNA em uma única base nucleotídica que nos permite traçar propensões e características, ou como eu prefiro chamar, fenótipos.

Com base nos dados fornecidos por esses exames de DNA, eu desenvolvi um Analisador de DNA em Python, que realiza todo o processamento através de um Notebook do Google Cloud.
Este analisador faz o upload dos dados brutos do DNA e os compara com um banco de dados, também de minha autoria.
O meu banco de dados de fenótipos integra dados dos maiores bancos de dados genético de todo o mundo, um trabalho realmente único no Brasil.

Este trabalho contempla, com base no seu DNA, desde o descobrimento de variantes genéticas associadas ao desenvolvimentos de doenças, informações de como o seu corpo reage a determinados medicamentos, como o seu corpo absorve e interage com certos nutrientes e vitaminas, qual a eficácia de determinadas dietas, características da sua pele, características relacionadas ao envelhecimento, e curiosidades como predisposição ao alcoolismo, e muito mais.

O analisador pode ser visto no meu Repositório β (público) no GitHub.
Quanto ao trabalho de web scraping para formação e atualização do Banco de Dados, bem como o próprio Banco de Dados, este não estarei divulgando, ao menos neste primeiro momento, em que ainda não me decidi quanto ao fim pretendido, se irei disponibilizar gratuitamente para pesquisadores, se irei vender este trabalho ou vender serviços relacionados a este.

Acredito que poderei ajudar no descobrimento de predisposições genéticas em primeira mão ao pesquisador brasileiro e internacional, e poderei também fornecer aos laboratórios clínicos e farmácias uma ferramenta revolucionária para a prevenção de doenças antes delas acontecerem, bem como ferramentas de desempenho atlético para centros esportivos e dados nutricionais para academias, tudo isso com um teste simples de raspagem de cotonete na bochecha, e posterior tratamento de dados, por um valor absurdamente baixo em relação ao benefício fornecido.

É importante saber que há outros fatores, além dos genéticos, que influenciam no seu corpo, e que uma predisposição não é uma sentença, já que um fenótipo não é apenas determinado pelo genótipo, mas também pelo ambiente.
Conhecendo uma predisposição genética desde cedo, qualquer pessoa pode desenvolver hábitos que favoreçam ou desfavoreçam características especificas, portanto, acredito que todos deveriam ter essas informações sobre si.

**Linhagem Materna (haplogrupo materno): TIPO: H**

A partir de uma análise do DNA mitocondrial (mtDNA), sendo possível traçar o caminho que eles fizeram há mais de 100 mil anos.

Apenas a linhagem matrilinear, ou seja, a mãe, avó materna, bisavó materna, trisavó materna e, assim, sucessivamente, até milhares de anos atrás).

O haplogrupo H apareceu há cerca de 20 a 30 mil anos, descendendo da linhagem HV. Após seu surgimento, saiu do Oriente Médio, espalhando-se principalmente pela Europa e também pelo norte da África. Atualmente, existem cerca de 100 ramificações dentro do haplogrupo H.
